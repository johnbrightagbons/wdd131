                <h2>A Little History About Nigeria</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>Nigeria, officially the Federal Republic of Nigeria, is a country in West Africa. 
                    It is the most populous country in Africa and the seventh most populous in the world, with more than 206 million inhabitants. 
                    Nigeria is a multinational state inhabited by more than 250 ethnic groups speaking 500 distinct languages, all identifying with a wide variety of cultures. 
                    The three largest ethnic groups are the Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo. 
                    Nigeria is divided roughly in half between Christians, who live mostly in the southern part of the country, and Muslims, who live mostly in the north. 
                    A minority of the population practice religions indigenous to Nigeria, such as those native to the Igbo and Yoruba ethnicities.</p>
